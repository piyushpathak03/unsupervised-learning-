# unsupervised-learning
Unsupervised Learning is a machine learning technique in which the users do not need to supervise the model. Instead, it allows the model to work on its own to discover patterns and information that was previously undetected. It mainly deals with the unlabelled data.

## Unsupervised Learning
In some pattern recognition problems, the training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding target values. The goal in such unsupervised learning problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where it is called clustering, or to determine how the data is distributed in the space, known as density estimation. To put forward in simpler terms, for a n-sampled space x1 to xn, true class labels are not provided for each sample, hence known as learning without teacher.
Issues with Unsupervised Learning:
Unsupervised Learning is harder as compared to Supervised Learning tasks..
How do we know if results are meaningful since no answer labels are available?
Let the expert look at the results (external evaluation)
Define an objective function on clustering (internal evaluation)


Why Unsupervised Learning is needed despite of these issues?
Annotating large datasets is very costly and hence we can label only a few examples manually. Example: Speech Recognition
There may be cases where we don‚Äôt know how many/what classes is the data divided into. Example: Data Mining
We may want to use clustering to gain some insight into the structure of the data before designing a classifier.
Unsupervised Learning can be further classified into two categories:

Parametric Unsupervised Learning
In this case, we assume a parametric distribution of data. It assumes that sample data comes from a population that follows a probability distribution based on a fixed set of parameters. Theoretically, in a normal family of distributions, all members have the same shape and are parameterized by mean and standard deviation. That means if you know the mean and standard deviation, and that the distribution is normal, you know the probability of any future observation. Parametric Unsupervised Learning involves construction of Gaussian Mixture Models and using Expectation-Maximization algorithm to predict the class of the sample in question. This case is much harder than the standard supervised learning because there are no answer labels available and hence there is no correct measure of accuracy available to check the result.

Non-parametric Unsupervised Learning
In non-parameterized version of unsupervised learning, the data is grouped into clusters, where each cluster(hopefully) says something about categories and classes present in the data. This method is commonly used to model and analyze data with small sample sizes. Unlike parametric models, nonparametric models do not require the modeler to make any assumptions about the distribution of the population, and so are sometimes referred to as a distribution-free method.

What is Clustering?
Clustering can be considered the most important unsupervised learning problem; so, as every other problem of this kind, it deals with finding a structure in a collection of unlabeled data. A loose definition of clustering could be ‚Äúthe process of organizing objects into groups whose members are similar in some way‚Äù. A cluster is therefore a collection of objects which are ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù between them and are ‚Äúdissimilar‚Äù to the objects belonging to other clusters.
